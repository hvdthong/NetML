[PATCH] signjar new preservelastmodified attribute
Noting that the signjar task does not allow a preservelastmodified attribute (as
the ftp and copy tasks do) I enhanced it myself. Please note that I don't have
direct CVS access and so cannot generate a diff. I enclose the SignJar.java
file, downloaded on sept 1 of 2004, patched in two hours and enclosed here. The
important lines are the if at the end of the doOneJar method, and of course the
setter of the attribute. Anyway, whomever can make a diff will see the changes.

Could you please include the fix into the next release? The point is, we need to
deploy a signed JWS application, and the jar timestamp is used to check if the
revision has changed. So, we wanted to not modify the timestamp if we simply
sign the jar again.

Thanks. I'm available for feedback, should it be needed.
