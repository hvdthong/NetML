Provide access to extension points and attribute/element/extensions/text methods in IntrospectionHelper
IntrospectionHelper did not provide access to the new Ant 1.6+ extension 
points. It also did not provide access to the actual method used to 
set/add/create an attribute/element/extension point/text, which is necessary 
to link an attribute/element with the corresponding method Javadoc in the 
source.

This patch provides the added functionality, fully unit tested. Also tests the 
sorting of extension points with the most derived ones first in the list. --DD
