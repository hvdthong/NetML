condition task should support optional value for false
It would be convenient to have the condition task take an additional "otherwise"
value for the property if the condition evaluates to false.  Not supplying this
woulg give the current behaviour, i.e. not setting the property.  

The workaround is simple enough:  use the condition task to set if true, and a
subsequent property task to set if it hasn't been set yet (condition was false.)

It would be both more elegant and clear with something like 

<condition property="prop1" value="true" otherwise="false">
    <some supported condition>
</condition>

The code change is simple.  The documentation changes are a little more
substantial.  (I tested the former, but haven't investigated the latter.)
