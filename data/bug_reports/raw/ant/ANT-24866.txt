java.io.FileNotFoundException in <style>
When I using <style> task to transform xml ant throws FileNotFoundException.
at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.XSLTProcess.process(XSLTProcess.java:497)
at org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.XSLTProcess.execute(XSLTProcess.java:267)
...
The problem is with path names, when basedir (of style task) contains subdirectories
It occurs if I don't use the includes attribute or use it with **/*. or **/*.*
but not if **/*.ext (fortunatelly)
It does not occur if basedir of task contains no directory.
An example 
If I have basedir/subdir/foo.xml it reports basedir/foo.xml not found
so subdir dissappears, as I find out from sources.
Hope it helps.
