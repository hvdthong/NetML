BZip2: faster, less memory
I have a patch here to speed up the BZip2 task (50-90%). At the same time this 
patch achieves lower memory usage (35%). 
It's well tested. 
 
Please note this is the first time I'm trying to contribute a patch to 
apache...hoping I can create an attachment on the next page. 
If not, I will send the patch to Keiron Liddle (keiron@aftexsw.com), the 
author of the current version.
