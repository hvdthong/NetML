Ant task - allow multiple targets
I would like for the ant task to allow multiple targets in the same way that I 
can specify multiple targets on the command line when kicking off ant.

I have made the following changes to ant.java in the 1.4.1 release that does 
just that.  Most of this additional logic is cut-n-pasted from Target.java's 
code for parsing the depends attribute so it has the same error checking as 
that.
