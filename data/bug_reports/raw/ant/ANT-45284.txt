allow for regular expressions in FileSet include and exclude
In fileset includes and excludes, it would be helpful to be able to use regular expressions, not just wild cards.
My immediate problem is that we have previous directories which are dates, eg /20080624/, containing archived files, which I want to exclude from my fileset.

Also, in current directories, we have obsolete files which include the date in the name. eg., a common pattern for this is : abc.jarOLD20080624
I can't excluded files using *old* because "old" is part of legitimate names.

I ended up renaming the folders consisting of a date by adding "BAK" to the end; I was already excluding this pattern ("**/*bak/"

But I don't have control over what other people name files and folders, so I have to spend time checking that I'm not copying and jarring stuff I don't want that's been added since the last time, w/o excluding stuff I do want.

Being able to test for a filename using a regular expression (eg., containing 8 consecutive numerals) would be very useful.
