execution of top level tasks in imported files get delayed by targets
I've stripped down the problem mentioned in
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ant-user&m=109655281326491&w=2>.

Suppose we have

outer.xml
=========
<project name="outer">
  <import file="inner.xml"/>
  <property name="foo" value="${bar}"/>
  <echo>foo is ${foo}</echo>
</project>

inner.xml
=========
<project name="inner">
  <target name="baz"/>
  <property name="bar" value="bar is set"/>
  <echo>bar is ${bar}</echo>
</project>

This results in

[bodewig@bodewig tmp]$ ant -f outer.xml 
Buildfile: outer.xml
     [echo] foo is ${bar}
     [echo] bar is bar is set

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 second


Now remove the target from inner.xml

[bodewig@bodewig tmp]$ ant -f outer.xml 
Buildfile: outer.xml
     [echo] bar is set
     [echo] foo is bar is set

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 second

So if the imported file contains targets, its top level task get delayed until
the ones of the importing file are done.  If it doesn't, they get executed
immediately.  This is clearly wrong, both should behave the same way.

One can argue which way is the correct one, my vote would be for "execute
immediately" since it seems more intuitive.
