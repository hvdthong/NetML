add 'preservelastmodified' in replace task
Add 'preservelastmodified' in replace task to retain file timestamp similar to
<copy> and <move> tasks.

My current work-around is to use <move> and filter using ugly escape codes in
the string element.  The replace task would make this much easier by supporting
CDATA in nested tags.

Another enhancement request of this kind was made for <scp> and author provided
a fix there which might just call the -p option of scp executable (Bug #33939).
