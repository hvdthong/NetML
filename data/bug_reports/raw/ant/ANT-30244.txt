[PATCH] Add ability to set the request method when using the <http/> condition
Currently, the <http/> condition does an unconditional GET of a URL to
determine if it is available. This is generally not a problem unless you
need to check whether a large document is available. Then you have to 
download the whole thing.

The attached patch adds the ability to specify the HTTP request method when
checking a URL. This allows the use of an HTTP "HEAD" request to check to see 
if a document is available without downloading the whole document.

The patch is against the Ant HEAD branch as of this date and include a minor 
documentation change as well as the addition of a simple unit test for the
updated <http/> condition.
