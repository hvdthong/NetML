[PATCH] typedef doen't fail with resource could not be found
I looked at the documentation from both the current cvs build and 1.6.2 and
believe that the default behavior is for it to fail if it can't load a type or
task.  I specifically specified for it to fail and it still won't.  I know how
to solve this but would like my build files to fail when they can't load a type
or a task.  Is it supposed to behave this way when it loads properties from a
resource as opposed to name and class name?
