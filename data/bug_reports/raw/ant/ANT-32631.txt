allow includes / excludes for fileset references
If you define the following fileset as the whole webapp:

<fileset id="webapp">
  <!-- ... -->
</fileset>

.. then the following "constrained" reference should include only the WEB-INF
directory of the webapp:

<fileset refid="webapp" includes="WEB-INF/**"/>
