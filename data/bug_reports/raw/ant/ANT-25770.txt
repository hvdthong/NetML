[PATCH] FixCRLF "preserveLastModified"
can a boolean preserveLastModified attribute (that behaves similar to copy's) 
be added to FixCRLF:

example use case:
<fixCRLF srcDir="/badEOL" destDir="/fixedEOL" preserveLastModified="true">
<ftp ... depends="yes"/>

currently, fixCRLF will always generate a file w/ the current timestamp which 
means that FTP (which uses TS for dependency checking) will always transfer it
