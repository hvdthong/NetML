<fail> in an <imported> macro outputs wrong
write a macro, with <macrodef> and add it to a file that you <import>. Then run
in it. I would have expected to see the fail message, as you normally see, but
instead you see nesting information:

build.xml:184: Following error occured while executing this line
common.xml:121: Unit tests failed see

Is this appropriate?
