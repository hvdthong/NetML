Nested record tasks produces an empty output file
The setup is as follows: 
We compile a list of java projects, logging the output of each project. The
basic setup for each project is as follows:
---------------
<target name="parent">
<record name="${JavaLog}" action="start" loglevel="info"/>

<antfetch dir="[...]" target="child"/>

<record name="${JavaLog}" action="stop"/>
</target>
---------------

Now the child target tried to write to the same logfile, basically calling 
----------------
<target name="child">
<record name="${JavaLog} " action="start" append="true"/>
[...]
<record name="${JavaLog} " action="stop"/>
----------------

In Ant 1.6.5 no one noticed, because the output looked fine. Starting with ant
1.7.0 however the output becomes strange: After the "stop" in the parent target
the logfile is empty (contains zero bytes). If I insert a fail immediately
before the "stop" command in the parent target then everything is fine. If I do
not close the log file at all (in the parent target) then  the logfile is there
- in some cases. In other cases it contains the last line of the output, or
sometimes nothing at all, and a lot of binary zeros. Seems like the content of
the logfile is overwritten with zeros before it is flushed. This behavior is
reproducable.
