xmlproperty to support xmlcatalog
I have an xml file that with a doctype declaration of <!DOCTYPE skinconfig
PUBLIC "-//Apache Software Foundation//DTD Forrest Skin Configuration 1.0//EN"
"http://xml.apache.org/forrest/dtd/skinconf_1_0.dtd">  Without network access
(and presumable with it to, since the dtd hasn't been posted), I cannot load
this xml file using xmlproperty.  I can succesfully use xmlvalidate (with an
xmlcatalog element) to validate the file.

Please add support for an <xmlcatalog> subelement to the <xmlproperty> task. 
Thanks!
