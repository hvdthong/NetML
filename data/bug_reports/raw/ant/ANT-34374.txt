regexp cannot be negated
There is no way to negate a regexp. For example, the following will find lines 
containing "foo":

      <filterchain>
        <linecontainsregexp>
            <regexp pattern="foo*"/>
        </linecontainsregexp>
      </filterchain>

But there is no way to find lines that do *not* contain "foo".
