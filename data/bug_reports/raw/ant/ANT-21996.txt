add a flatten option in the unzip task
same behavior expected as in the "copy" task

this would greatly simplify some tasks where I have to specify the exact 
location of the extracted files. You can also use a "copy" with a flatten 
option to complete the work but a single command is better.

same for unzip/untar/unwar...

This functionality is not present in 1.5.3

Thanks
