Please add 'level' property to JAR/ZIP tasks
Jar/ZIP tasks lack of compression level settings. It's really important when 
building JARs for J2ME platform where the size really matters!!! I changed the 
code in the sources locally and hardcoded level to Deflater.BEST_COMPRESSION 
but this change might be helpful for other developers!
