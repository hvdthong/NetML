Targets with identical name work in imported project
Hi,

here is a real hidden feature of ant which I like quite well :). Consider the
following  build file:

build.xml:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?>
<project name="test" default="test-id">
	<target name="test-id" id="case1" if="property">
		<echo>Property is set.</echo>
	</target>
	<target name="test-id" id="case2" unless="property">
		<echo>Property is not set.</echo>
	</target>
</project>

This fails (as expected):

C:\workspace\Utilitiy Project>ant
Buildfile: build.xml

BUILD FAILED
C:\workspace\Utilitiy Project\build.xml:6: Duplicate target 'test-id'

Total time: 0 seconds

But consider the following use of an import Statement:

build.xml:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?>
<project name="test" default="test-id">
	<import file="test.xml" />
</project>

test.xml:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?>
<project default="test-id">
	<target name="test-id" id="case1" if="property">
		<echo>Property is set.</echo>
	</target>
	<target name="test-id" id="case2" unless="property">
		<echo>Property is not set.</echo>
	</target>
</project>

This should fail as well? Surprise! It works. Output of ant:

C:\workspace\Utilitiy Project>ant
Buildfile: build.xml

test-id:

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 0 seconds

I do not know whether this behavior should be considered as a bug - I like it.
Could the differentiation of targets by ID instead of names be implemented. It
would save the use of a dummy target which depends on the two or more case-tags.
