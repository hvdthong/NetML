Base64Converter not properly bytes with MSB set (not masking byte to int conversion).

Every 3rd byte taken for conversion (least significant in triplet is not being masked with added to integer, if the msb is set this leads to a signed extension which overwrites the previous two bytes with all ones.

bits24 |= octetString[i++];

Should be:
bits24 |= octetString[i++] & BYTE_MASK;
