Adding property element to xmlvalidate
I needed a way to set properties on the XMLReader used for validation, by
calling the method XMLReader.setProperty(String, Object).

My need for this was to specify an external schema to validate an XML file with.
 Setting attributes can't get the job done since it only accepts booleans.

It's a fairly simple patch.  It includes a few new methods and an inner classes
in XmlValidateTask which mimic the logic for setAttribute.  I also added some
test cases, and 2 test xml files, one which passes the schema and one which doesn't.
