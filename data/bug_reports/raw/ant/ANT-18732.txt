expand properties during -propertyfile processing
I set my ANT_OPTS='-propertyfile ant.properties'.  ANT does not recognize the 
comand-line parameter -propertyfile.  This is an obvious bug.

I suggest that ANT should always accept an optional default property file 
(possibly ant.properties).  ANT should optionally accept also accept ALL 
command-line parameters on the property file.  The ANT_OPTS is difficult to 
change and manipulate.

Also, ANT should accept macro expressions in its property file.  It does not 
accept such expression now.  For instance it should accept such thing as:
  root.path=${basedir}/sources
