junit-frames.xsl included with ant does not properly deal with stack traces
Latest version of junit xslt style sheet does not properly replace stack trace 
carriage returns with <br> tags (looks like it just removes the carriage 
returns). 

Ths bug was introduced in v1.17 of src/etc/junit-frames.xsl. According to the 
checkin comments for 1.17, the change was necessary to avoid stack overflow 
issues.

To workaround the problem I extracted the latest junit-frames.xsl and reverted 
the br-replace function (to rev 1.16). Using this as a custom style sheet for 
junitreport worked.
