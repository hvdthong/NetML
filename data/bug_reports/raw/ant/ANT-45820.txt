IsSigned conditions doesn't work correctly for alias with invalid characters
The IsSigned condition correctly upercases the name and shortens it to eight characters but the tool documentation page of jarsigner reads 

> If no -sigfile option appears on the command line, the base file name for the
> .SF and .DSA files will be the first 8 characters of the alias name specified
> on the command line, all converted to upper case. > If the alias name has fewer
> than 8 characters, the full alias name is used.
> If the alias name contains any characters that are not allowed in a signature
> file name, each such character is converted to an underscore ("_") character
> in forming the file name. Legal characters include letters, digits, underscores,
> and hyphens.

Ant currently lacks the "replace illegal characters with underscores" part.

Note that the spec doesn't say it would treat -sigfile provided names the same
way, but the documentation of the -sigfile option restricts the legal values so assuming -sigfile provided names can be matched the same way should be fine.
