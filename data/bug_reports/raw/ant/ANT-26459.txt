SQL task (SQLExec class) might not see a ROW delimiter correctly
Hi,

In the SQL task, using the option "keepformat" will prevent SQL statements lines
from having their spaces trimed out.

This can prevent ANT from seing a ROW delimiter, which is being found only if an
entire line equals the delimiter.

In example, if I write the following with the options 'delimiter' set to 'GO',
'delimitertype' set to 'row', and 'keepformat' set to 'true':

SELECT * ... FROM ...
GO  

And I put one or more spaces after the 'GO' statement, then it will not trigger
sending of the 'SELECT' statement to the database.

A simple solution would be changing source code of SQLExec class, and replace
lines from method 'runStatements':

(delimiterType.equals(DelimiterType.ROW)
&& line.equals(delimiter)))

by

(delimiterType.equals(DelimiterType.ROW)
&& line.trim().equals(delimiter)))
