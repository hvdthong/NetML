IOException while closing TarOutputStream twice
When TarOutputStream is closed twice, it throws an exception because closing the
stream involve writing to the stream, and there is no check if the stream is
already closed.

All streams in the Java base libraries can be closed twice, and
file:///home/oysteigi/inn/docs/api/index.html says it explicitly.
