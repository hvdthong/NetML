sync task to ignore destination files
Using <fileset>, source files and directories can be excluded from the sync. 
However, it would be very useful to ignore files and directories from the
destination.

For example, I have a subdirectory 'xdocs' in my destination directory that has
lots of files in it and my source directory doesn't have 'xdocs'.  When I do a
<sync>, 'xdocs' is deleted.  I want to ignore 'xdocs' and just synchronize
everything else.
