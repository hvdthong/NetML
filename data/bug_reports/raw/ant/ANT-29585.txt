<apply>: Filelist's behaving like filesets - Require files to be present in order to be included.
Filelists are supposed to be list of files which may or maynot exist as apposed 
to filesets which compose of files which must exist. When I pass a filelist to 
a apply task it skips the files if they dont exist. The target definition is as 
follows...

<target name="test">
	<apply dir="." executable="something.exe">
		<arg value="param1"/>
		<srcfile/>
		<filelist id="test.me" dir="." files="test2.tst test1.tst"/>
	</apply>
</target>

The problem seems to reside in this section of the code in 
org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs ...

File f = new File(base, names[j]);
if ((f.isFile() && !"dir".equals(type))
    || (f.isDirectory() && !"file".equals(type))) {

     if (f.isFile()) {
        totalFiles++;
     } else {
         totalDirs++;
     }
     
When I comment out this code the files are added as desired.
