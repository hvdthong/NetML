The build time is not printed correctly for builds that take a long time
The build time is not printed correctly when a build takes a very long time.

For example with a build that took around two days, it printed 2รก926 minutes 13 seconds.

It could look as when it takes more than 1000 minutes to build, something wrong happens with the formatting.



Buildfile: build.xml

run:

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 2รก926 minutes 13 seconds
