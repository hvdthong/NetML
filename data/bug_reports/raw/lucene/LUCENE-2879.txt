MultiPhraseQuery sums its own idf instead of Similarity.
 MultiPhraseQuery is a generalized version of PhraseQuery, and computes IDF the same way by default (by summing across the terms). 

 The problem is it doesn't let the Similarity do this: PhraseQuery calls Similarity.idfExplain(Collection&lt;Term&gt; terms, IndexSearcher searcher), 
but MultiPhraseQuery just sums itself, calling Similarity.idf(int, int) for each term.
