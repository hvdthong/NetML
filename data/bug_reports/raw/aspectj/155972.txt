NullPointerException in ConstructorSignature.getConstructor()
AspectJ version: 1.5.3.200608290814

When advising a constructor, we can do the following to obtain the constructor as a java.lang.reflect.Member:

		Member cons = ((ConstructorSignature) thisJoinPointStaticPart
				.getSignature()).getConstructor();

however that sometimes fails, and returns null.
