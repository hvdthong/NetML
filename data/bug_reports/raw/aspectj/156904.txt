Incorrect warning when advising a private method of a private inner class
The Eclipse AJDT give an incorrect warning when you want to advise a private method of a private inner class.


When I want to advise a private method in a private inner class, like this

public class Outer
{
   private class Inner
   {
      private void myMethod()
   }
}

Using the following poincut:

poincut innerpointcut():execution( * Outer.Inner.myMethod() );

and advice:

before():innerpointcut()
{
   System.out.println( "executing!" );
}

I get a warning "invalidAbsoluteTypeName" next to my pointcut, but next to the advice, there is a marker that points to the private method.
