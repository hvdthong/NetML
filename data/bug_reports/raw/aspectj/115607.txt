Incorrect structure model for simple declare @type program?
This program:
---8<-----
@interface I {}

class Simple {}

public aspect C {
  declare @type: Simple : @I;
}
---8<-----
(all in a file called C.java, open with the AJ editor) when built shows
incorrect gutter markers, it shows a double headed arrow on Simple implying that
it annotates itself - rather than something outgoing from the declare statement
and something incoming on the Simple type.
