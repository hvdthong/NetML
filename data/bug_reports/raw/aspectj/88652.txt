an array type as the last parameter in a signature does not match on the varargs declared method
I get this warning in my code, though I actually do not specify an array type.

The signature I want to match is the following constructor signature:

public Touple(Object formulaHandle, Object... propositions) {...}

Touple implements IRelation

The pointcut I use is the following:

pointcut p(): call(Touple.new(..));

This should actually match the signature, shouldn't it?
AspectJ however complains with this warning:

an array type as the last parameter in a signature does not match on the varargs 
declared method: void ltlrv.Touple.<init>(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object[]) 
[Xlint:cantMatchArrayTypeOnVarargs]

Also, even if I *had* stated an array type, it should match even then IMHO, 
since arrays and varargs are actually the same in the Java implementation.
