declare parents implementing generic interface referencing same type
I have the following construct:

public interface TestIF<T extends TestIF> {}

public class TestClass {}

public aspect TestAspect {

    declare parents: TestClass implements TestIF<TestClass>; 

}



The later aspect does not compile, although 

public class TestClass implements TestIF<TestClass> {

}
is a valid class.
