When defining a setter on an host object for a field that implements Scriptable, Rhino throws EcmaError
org.mozilla.javascript.EcmaError: TypeError: Cannot convert null to an object.
when trying to assign null value.

A workaround consists in changing the signature of the setter to accept java.lang.Object instead of the desired Scriptable, but it is not pleasant.
