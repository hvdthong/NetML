A labeled while loop generates the warning "Code has no side effects" when the loop has obvious side effects.  It does not matter if the loop actually makes any use of the label with break/continue.

let x = 1;
bar : while ( x < 200 ) {
  x = x + 1;
} // "Warning: Code has no side effects" on this line

Only tested with language version at 1.8; but tested with various optimizer levels.
