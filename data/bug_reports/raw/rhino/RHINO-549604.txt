NativeError already has two interesting non ECMA properties: lineNumber and fileName. It would be useful to have property stack as well as done in different browsers.

Additionally, the information returned by RhinoException.getScriptStackTrace vary depending on the optimization level used. In interpreted mode in contains the function name whereas it is not the case in compiled mode.

Reproducible: Always
