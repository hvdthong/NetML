Properties defined as read only (with only a GetterSlot) could be set without problem until Rhino 1.7R2 and we used this feature in HtmlUnit.

Since 1.7R2 an exception is thrown in such a case what breaks our code. Attached patch adds a new Context feature allowing to have this "feature" again

Reproducible: Always
