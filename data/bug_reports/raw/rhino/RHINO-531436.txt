parseFloat fails on number followed by "e" that is not exponent
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; fr; rv:1.9.0.15) Gecko/2009102815 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.15
Build Identifier: 

parseFloat incorrectly returns NaN for strings like:
- 789e
- 789efgh
- 789e+
- 789e-
- 789e+hello

The "e" is recognized as the beginning of an exponent but if what follows is not a valid exponent, it should be ignored. See ECMA spec 15.1.2.3.


Reproducible: Always
